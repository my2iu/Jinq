/**
 * The JinqStream is a normal Java 8 stream extended with extra methods. These
 * extra methods are needed because:
 * <ul>
 * <li>They can be more easily analyzed by Jinq
 * <li>They provide extra functionality that more closely mirrors database query
 * functionality
 * <li>They have names that are derived from database query syntax instead of
 * names derived from functional programming syntax
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Programmers typically get access to <code>JinqStream</code>s through a
 * JinqStream provider. For example, the
 * {@code org.jinq.jpa.JinqJPAStreamProvider} is able to create streams of JPA
 * entities from a database. It is also possible to create
 * <code>JinqStream</code>s from collections and single objects.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *           type of object that is being processed by the stream
